# Scholarship-Tracking

# Project Overview
Project working on a solution to help students easily connect to scholarships and grants that meet their qualifying criteria.

## Vision & Goals
- Scholarship seekers are able to search, track and apply directly from a one-stop shop. 
- Scholarship creators make opportunities available for seekers to find. 
## Project Vertical
- Nonprofit
- Other: Although this could be implemented into NPSP from a scholarship creator's persepctive, this is primarily focused on individual scholasrhip seekers so not sure if this fits into any one vertical.

- We need people from the scholarship creators to give us insight into their processes & marketing efforts. 
- We need design thinkers (UX/UI) to help us create an amazing experience for our users.
